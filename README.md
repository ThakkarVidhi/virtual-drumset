## FAQs

### **How do I change the key bindings?**  
At the moment, key bindings are hard-coded. However, you can:  
1. Open an issue to suggest a feature for customizable key bindings.  
2. Contribute directly by adding this feature and submitting a pull request.  

> **Tip:** Look into the `index.js` file for the key binding logic if you'd like to customize it manually.
